I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) advised by Prof. Junmo Kim. I received my M.S. and B.S. degrees in electrical engineering from KAIST in 2020 and 2018, respectively.

During my Ph.D., I have pursued research with the goal of capturing human-related subjects (e.g., pose and shape of a human body) considering practically useful usage settings, and reconstructing them into a virtual world. Specifically, my research has involved human body joint estimation in camera lens distortion environments and human body mesh reconstruction in the presence of ambiguity, such as occlusion.

During my Ph.D. studies, I was fortunate enough to do two internships at Metaâ€”one in Pittsburgh, PA, USA, and another currently ongoing in Redmond, WA, USA. Additionally, I was selected as a finalist for the Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship in 2022 and 2023.
