I recently earned my PhD in Electrical Engineering from KAIST, where I was advised by Prof. Junmo Kim. I previously obtained my MS (2020) and BS (2018) in Electrical Engineering from KAIST.

My doctoral research focused on capturing and reconstructing human-related subjects—such as body pose and shape—under real-world conditions for practical applications in immersive environments. In particular, I investigated human body joint estimation in camera lens distortion scenarios and human body mesh reconstruction in the presence of ambiguities, such as occlusion.

During my PhD studies, I gained valuable experience through two internships at Meta Reality Labs—one in Pittsburgh, PA, USA (2023), and another in Redmond, WA, USA (2024). I was also honored to be selected as a finalist for the Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship in both 2022 and 2023.
